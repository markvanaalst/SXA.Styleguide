The SXA Styleguide is an education site based on SXA that helps explaining the inner working and illustrating best practices.

It should not be considered as a demo environment for SXA or Sitecore in general. For demo purposes we like to refer you to
[Habitat Home](https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore.HabitatHome.Platform), the official demo environment maintained by Sitecore and available as open-source.

## Prerequisites

The Styleguide is built to support
**[Sitecore Experience Platform 10.1](https://dev.sitecore.net/Downloads/Sitecore_Experience_Platform/101/Sitecore_Experience_Platform_101.aspx)** using
**[Sitecore Experience Accelerator (SXA) 10.1](https://dev.sitecore.net/Downloads/Sitecore_Experience_Accelerator/10x/Sitecore_Experience_Accelerator_1010.aspx)**.

## Quickstart (recommended approach)

You can install the styleguide on a Sitecore 10 instance with SXA 10.1 installed. Installation can be done using the package you can download from the
[releases page](https://github.com/markvanaalst/SXA.Styleguide/releases).

## Development: Running the Stylguide on Docker

#### Requirements

1. Windows 1809 or higher, but prefer version 1909
2. The latest Docker Desktop **[Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)**
3. From the Docker Desktop menu, you can toggle which daemon (Linux or Windows) the Docker CLI talks to. Select Switch to Windows containers to use
   `Windows containers`
4. More information about running Sitecore on Docker can be found [here](https://containers.doc.sitecore.com/docs/intro)

#### Starting the Styleguide

1. Clone or copy the repository
2. Open a powershell console (in administrator mode) and run `.\Init.ps1 -LicenseXmlPath C:\PATH\TO\YOUR\License.xml`

The script will

- Retrieve and import SitecoreDockerTools module
- Populate the environment file
- Configure TLS/HTTPS certificates
- Add Windows hosts file entries
- Run the docker containers
- Login to Sitecore and push serialized items
